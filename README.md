Exploring websockets through a simple chatroom application

The vast majority of the websocket logic came from this project:
https://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket

First, run ```bundle install```
Then, ```bundle exec ruby app.rb```

Navigate to ```http://localhost:3000``` and have fun talking to yourself!
